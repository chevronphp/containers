# chevron.containers

Chevron aims to be a 'simple set of useful tools'. This means that it
exists as a humble collection of code I've written and found quite useful.

The containers module is a simple implementation of a registry pattern. The
base container takes values and returns them, the deferred container is built
to handle callables, and the reference container is meant to handle maps--wait
for it--by reference.
